### Project Overview
This project analyzes a large-scale AWS cloud service disruption that occurred in October and presents an improved, customer-focused incident response strategy.

Rather than documenting the incident alone, this project focuses on identifying response gaps and proposing faster, clearer, and more effective response actions that could reduce operational impact for cloud-dependent organizations.

### What This Project Demonstrates
- Incident response planning for cloud outages
- Critical analysis of real-world cloud disruptions
- Improved escalation, communication, and recovery strategies
- Alignment between technical response and business continuity

### Deliverables
- Full Incident Response & Optimization Plan (Word document)
- Supporting documentation outlining timelines, communications, roles, and lessons learned
